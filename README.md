# CAUTION

This is not a secure api and therefore it is not meant to be used for anyone's serious project. Treat this project as a dummy project that you can use to explore and see how a basic REST api is created with node/express.
Take this caution seriously.

## WHAT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO DO WITH THE REPO

This is an open project and therefore you are allowed to clone it and work on it on your own machine to get to explore how basic apis are made.

## HOW TO TEST

To test the API, you can use your browser or you may use postman for testing the different methods easily. I, the author of the project, recommend testing the API using postman because if you choose to use your browser, you will be required to at least to create a front end model that will allow you to communicate with the endpoints.
However, be reminded that you are not restricted to any manner of testing as any chosen manner is valid as long as you explore the API fully and learn from the project.
